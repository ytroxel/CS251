/* (Invoice Class) Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent an invoice for an item sold at 
the store. An Invoice should include four data members—a part num- ber (type string), a part description (type string), a 
quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a price per item (type int). [Note: In subsequent chapters, we’ll use 
numbers that contain decimal points (e.g., 2.75)—called floating-point values—to represent dollar amounts.] Your class should 
have a constructor that initializes the four data members. A constructor that receives multiple arguments is defined with the 
form:
ClassName( TypeName1 parameterName1, TypeName2 parameterName2, ... )*/
